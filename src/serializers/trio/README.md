While we’ve shown how to wire up any parser in a reactive pipeline, when it comes to Ultra-JSON (the ujson-inspired StreamingJsonParser), there are a few notable constraints:

No True Incremental API
The real ujson C library doesn’t expose a low-level, incremental parsing interface—we’re simulating it by buffering bytes and using Python’s json.loads. That means:

You can only parse complete JSON fragments. If your chunk boundary cuts through a multi-byte Unicode sequence or a number literal, you must buffer until the next safe boundary.

Partial object reconstruction (our fallback) is heuristic and fragile for deeply nested or complex structures.

CPU-Bound C Extension
While Python’s json is pure-Python, real ultra-JSON (ujson) is a C extension that blocks the thread for the entire parse call. In our reactive tests we wrap consume() in trio.to_thread.run_sync or loop.run_in_executor, but:

Latency spikes occur per chunk, since each chunk parse still runs to completion before yielding back to the event loop or nursery.

There's no fine-grained yielding inside a single consume() invocation—if one chunk is large, you’ll block until it finishes.

GIL and Parallelism

Because ujson releases the GIL only during its C routines, you get some concurrency in a multithreaded executor—but you’ll still contend for the GIL on Python-side object creation.

For true multi-core parsing you’ll need separate processes (e.g. via trio-parallel or Tractor), adding serialization overhead for each chunk.

Memory Growth and Backpressure

We rely on Trio channels’ backpressure to prevent unbounded buffering, but if the producer outpaces even thread-offloaded parses, channel senders will block.

Chunk size tuning matters: too small and you pay framing/overhead cost; too large and you pay increased parse latency and potential memory pressure.

Error Recovery Complexity

If a JSON fragment is malformed or incomplete, our parser falls back to partial reconstruction logic. In real-world LLM streaming (where outputs can include streaming tokens like "Hell → "Hello") errors are expected, but robust recovery in ujson style is hard.

You’ll need to augment the parser with token-level validation or a proper incremental state machine to handle arbitrarily truncated inputs safely.

In practice, an ultrajson_parser can participate in a reactive Trio pipeline, but to make it truly non-blocking and robust you will likely need to:

Wrap each parse call in a thread or process pool to avoid blocking the event loop.

Design a stateful buffering layer that knows JSON token boundaries precisely (e.g. via a pure-Python incremental tokenizer) before handing complete tokens to ujson.loads.

Use backpressure and chunk-size heuristics to balance latency vs throughput.

Consider a hybrid approach: a pure-Python incremental lexer for streaming tokens, feeding occasional full-object slices to ujson for high-speed parse of completed data.

With those in place, you can deliver low-latency, reactive JSON parsing—even for very large LLM outputs—while avoiding the pitfalls of synchronous C-extension blocking.


pattern maps almost exactly to an Erlang‐style “OTP supervisor + mailbox” approach, but built on Trio’s channels (or Tractor’s actor mailboxes) instead of Erlang’s primitives. Here’s roughly how it could look:

Supervisor as a registry of mailboxes
You spin up a “Supervisor” object whose job is to spawn, track, and clean up per-message mailboxes. Each mailbox is just a Trio memory-channel pair (send/recv) keyed by a unique “message ID” (or chunk ID).

Stashing every partial chunk
When your I/O layer yields a new bit of JSON (or LLM token), it arrives tagged with an ID. You do something like:

python
Copy
Edit
async def on_chunk(id: str, chunk: str):
    # Create a mailbox for this ID if it doesn’t yet exist
    if id not in supervisor.mailboxes:
        supervisor.mailboxes[id] = trio.open_memory_channel(buffer_size)
        # And immediately spawn a parser task to consume from that mailbox
        nursery.start_soon(_run_parser, id, *supervisor.mailboxes[id])
    send_chan, _ = supervisor.mailboxes[id]
    await send_chan.send(chunk)
Every incoming partial piece is pushed into the appropriate channel (“mailbox”) for that message.

Parser tasks reading from mailboxes
Each parser task is simply:

python
Copy
Edit
async def _run_parser(id, send_chan, recv_chan):
    parser = StreamingJsonParser()
    async with recv_chan:
        async for bit in recv_chan:
            parser.consume(bit)
            if parser.has_complete_object():
                full = parser.get()
                # deliver full result somewhere…
                break
    # signal completion
    await supervisor.mark_done(id)
That loop accumulates bits from the mailbox until the parser recognizes a full JSON object.

Unregistering on completion
In supervisor.mark_done(id) you:

python
Copy
Edit
async def mark_done(self, id):
    send_chan, recv_chan = self.mailboxes.pop(id)
    await send_chan.aclose()  # stop any further sends
    # optional: drain recv_chan or just let it close
    # at this point all buffered bits for `id` are dropped
This automatically drops any partial bits still sitting in the channel buffer.

Hierarchy & fault‐tolerance
You can wrap each parser task in a Trio nursery that you treat as a “supervisor tree.” If a parser task crashes, the nursery cancels its siblings (or you can isolate it if you prefer), and the supervisor can restart that mailbox+parser pair if desired.

Benefits
Backpressure & buffering: each mailbox’s buffer only holds the un-parsed bits for one message.

Automatic cleanup: once a message completes, you tear down its channel and free its memory.

Structured concurrency: using Trio nurseries means you get clean cancellation and error propagation.

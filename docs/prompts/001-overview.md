I need to explore how to implement a parser algorithm with Python in a reactive way. As far as I know there are 3 major
implementations of non-blocking asynchronous reactive multi-threaded libraries:

- Asyncio latest
- Reactivex 4.0.4
- Dask latest
  And there are 8 top algorithms I can get inspiration from I have their python implementation attached
  and I would like to benchmark compare(I already have the code for this) all of them against their mono-threaded
  blocking peers.

The main objective is for me to land a job that has put out this challenge:

# DeepJudge.ai

Thank you for your interest in our software engineering position - we are excited to see what you can do!
We would like to ask you to complete a small coding task as part of our interview process.
This task should take you around an hour to complete.
The task description is as follows:

## Develop a Streaming JSON Parser

### Objective:
You are required to implement a streaming JSON parser that processes JSON data incrementally in Python.
The primary motivation for this task is to simulate partial responses as would be encountered in the streaming output of a large language model (LLM).

### Preconditions:
1. You can use whatever tools you want (Debugger, Editor, Copilot, ChatGPT, â€¦).
2. For this task, we consider a subset of JSON:
   - Values consist solely of strings and objects. 
   - Escape sequences in strings or duplicate keys in objects are not expected.

### Requirements:

### Requirements:
1. Create a class named `StreamingJsonParser`.
2. Implement the following methods within this class:
   1. `__init__()`: Initializes the parser.
   2. `consume(buffer: str)`: Consumes a chunk of JSON data.
   3. `get()`: Returns the current state of the parsed JSON object as an appropriate Python object.
   4. Even if the input JSON data is incomplete, the parser should be able to return the current state of the parsed JSON object at any given point in time.
   5. This should include partial string-values and objects, but not the keys themselves, 
   6. i.e. `{"test": "hello", "worl` is a partial representation of `{"test": "hello"}`, 
   7. `{"test": "hello", "worl": ""}` is not a valid representation of `{"test": "hello"}`
   8. The parser should be able to handle partial keys and partial string values.Partial Keys should NOT be returned. 
   9. Only once the value type of the key is determined should the parser return the key-value pair.
   10. Partial String values on the other hand can be partially returned: `{"test": "hello", "country": "Switzerl` is a partial representation of `{"test": "hello", "country": "Switzerl"}`.
   11. The parser should be efficient in terms of algorithmic complexity.

3. You may create a test function named `test_streaming_json_parser()` to verify the correctness of your implementation.
4. You may create additional helper classes or functions as needed.
5. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices for Python coding.
6. Include a docstring in your class and methods to explain the purpose and usage of each method.
7. Include a check function named `check_solution()` to verify the correctness of your solution against provided test cases.
   8. These are examples of made up test but that showcase how Parsers will be used to check your solution.
       #### Examples:
python
       def test_streaming_json_parser():
        parser = StreamingJsonParser()
        parser.consume('{"foo": "bar"}')
        assert parser.get() == {"foo": "bar"}
    
       def test_chunked_streaming_json_parser():
        parser = StreamingJsonParser()
        parser.consume('{"foo":')
        parser.consume('"bar')
        assert parser.get() == {"foo": "bar"}
    
       def test_partial_streaming_json_parser():
        parser = StreamingJsonParser()
        parser.consume('{"foo": "bar')
        assert parser.get() == {"foo": "bar"}
       
Once you're done, send us a python file with your solution as a response to this E-Mail.

> IMPORTANT: If you want your submission to be considered, please hand it in as a **single** python file called `guillermo_lam_streaming_json_parser.py`. Submissions that do not follow this pattern will not be considered.

Thank you and good luck!

1. First review all 8 implementations and make sure NON of them use the library json, instead we serialize or
   deserialize in non-human readable ways but in a potentially much faster fashion. Notice Init is just to create the
   instance of the selected parser, consume method starts the deserialization request and notice get method only
   performs a potentially blocking call to see the status or the serialization that may or may not be done. At that
   point every parser needs to apply the requirements around keys and values described earlier. BUT It does not mean
   what was passed argument by consume will equal what we obtain from get. It does however mean what gets printed out
   with get is a subset of characters of what was called by consume
2. Make Sure these 3 methods work as expected for these 8 files. Write on separate file all necessary tests to validate
   what this assignment challenge will be looking for, and what the reviewer
3. ACT a TOP Python engineer that knows SOLID, Clean code, and low level python programming. That knows how to write
   high performance secure python. Sanitizing paths, use system interruptions, knows how to write classes and methods in
   a veryt performant way.
